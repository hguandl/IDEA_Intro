# Configuration

When you first open IntelliJ IDEA, there will be a wizzard to guide you finish some configuration. Just click "next" is OK.

IntelliJ IDEA is quite user-friendly. We need only configure these presets:

- JDK: So that IDEA can find out the Java path.
- Editor: Customize the font and the color.
