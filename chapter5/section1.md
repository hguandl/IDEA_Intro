# Check your code

Please refer to the following checklist to inspect your code:


- The code can build successfully.
- The program can run as expected and pass the test cases.
- The input and output format should meet the requirements specified in the assignment document.
- No package in the first line.
- No Chinese characters.
- Proper indentation. ("Code - Reformat Code" may help you.) 
- Comments when necessary.
- **No plagiarism.** You are encouraged to search online when you meet problems, but never just copy and paste without any thinking. 
- **No plagiarism.** If you refer to any code online or copy from somewhere, you must specify the source (URL, book name, etc.) in the comments.
- **No plagiarism.** Any plagiarism would be punished seriously!
